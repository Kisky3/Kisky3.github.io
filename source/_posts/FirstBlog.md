Hey, I am Xiang Yu! :D Welcome to my blog!

I want to be a good front-end developer who can speak two foreign languages
(English and Japanese) in the furture.

Indoor-outdoor, cat lover, like chanllenging something new in my way.

Learning foreign languages, programming, keyboard, painting etc by myself just for fun XD. 
All are half-baked tho.

I will Continuously update this blog to record what I learned and experienced.

Thank you for taking the time to read it. Any helpful suggestions would be welcome！
